## Introduction
Street lighting is essential for public safety, yet traditional maintenance approaches often result in inefficiencies. This project proposes a centralized system leveraging advanced technology for real-time monitoring, fault detection, and location tracking of street lights. The goal is to streamline maintenance, reduce downtime, and enhance urban infrastructure resilience.

## Literature Survey
Previous studies highlight the importance of street light fault detection and tracking systems for urban management. Challenges such as limited resources and outdated practices necessitate innovative solutions. This section reviews existing methodologies and their limitations.

## Methodology
The proposed system integrates sensor technologies, data analytics, and centralized management platforms. It offers real-time monitoring and rapid fault detection, optimizing maintenance processes and improving resource allocation.

## System Block Diagram
The system architecture includes:
- Sensor nodes monitoring light intensity, electrical current, and temperature.
- Central monitoring station for data processing and analysis.
- Data storage solutions ensuring scalability and reliability.
- User interface for visualizing street light statuses and receiving alerts.

## Components Used
- **Light Intensity Sensors**: Monitor ambient light levels.
- **ESP8266**: Microcontroller for processing sensor data and controlling streetlights.
- **Communication Medium**: Protocols like Wi-Fi, Zigbee, LoRa, or cellular networks.
- **Central Monitoring System**: Server or cloud-based platform for data collection and analysis.
- **User Interface**: Web-based dashboard, mobile app, or desktop software.
- **Control Algorithms**: Determine streetlight operation based on sensor input.
- **Power Supply**: Mains power, battery backup, or solar panels.

## Working Process
### Hardware Side
- **ESP8266 Microcontrollers**: Low-cost, low-power consumption, built-in Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **LDR Sensors**: Measure ambient light levels, detecting faulty street lights.

### Software Side
- **Arduino IDE**: For programming ESP8266 microcontrollers.
- **Monitoring Webpage**: Hosted on GitHub Pages, displaying real-time sensor data and street light locations using Google Maps API.
- **ThingSpeak**: Cloud-based platform for data visualization and analysis.

### Connection Between Hardware and Software
The hardware components communicate sensor data to the software stack, enabling real-time monitoring and fault detection.

## Implementation
### Step 1: Setting Up Hardware
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**: Connect the ESP8266 to your light intensity sensor.
- **Light Intensity Sensor (LDR)**: Attach the sensor to each street light to measure the light intensity.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure that each sensor and microcontroller is connected to a stable power source.

### Step 2: Programming the Microcontroller
- **Arduino IDE**: Use the Arduino IDE to write and upload code to the ESP8266 microcontroller.
- **Sensor Data Collection**: Program the microcontroller to collect data from the light intensity sensor and send it to the central server.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Configure the ESP8266 to connect to the local Wi-Fi network for data transmission.

### Step 3: Setting Up the Central Monitoring System
- **Server Setup**: Set up a central server to receive and process data from the street lights.
- **Database Configuration**: Use a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store sensor data, fault logs, and location information.
- **ThingSpeak Configuration**: Use ThingSpeak for real-time data visualization and analytics.

### Step 4: Developing the User Interface
- **Web-based Dashboard**: Develop a web-based dashboard using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to display real-time street light statuses and fault alerts.
- **Google Maps API**: Integrate Google Maps API to show the locations of street lights and any detected faults.
- **User Management**: Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access to the dashboard.
